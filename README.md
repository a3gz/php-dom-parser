# PHP DOM Parser

This package is based on [Sunra's Simple PHP DOM Parser](https://github.com/sunra/php-simple-html-dom-parser). I created this repository because I needed a custom versioning history.

Unless you definitely need/like the changes I made, I would recommend using the original package since I believe it's still being maintained.
